## What is this?

This is an **experimental extension** of the original ox_lib that adds:

### üîß **Universal API System**

- `lib.player` - Player management functions
- `lib.task` - Task and animation utilities
- `lib.vehicle` - Vehicle manipulation tools
- `lib.enums` - Shared enumerations and constants

### üåê **Framework Wrappers**

- `lib.core` - Universal framework wrapper (ESX/QBCore)
- `lib.inventory` - Universal inventory wrapper (ox_inventory/qb-inventory/qs-inventory)
- `lib.dispatch` - Universal dispatch wrapper (cd_dispatch/ps-dispatch)
- `lib.phone` - Universal phone wrapper (qb-phone/qs-smartphone/etc)
- `lib.banking` - Universal banking wrapper (okokBanking/qb-banking/etc)

### ‚ú® **Key Features**

- **Auto-detection** of installed frameworks/systems
- **Normalized data structures** across different frameworks
- **Singleton pattern** for direct access
- **Lazy loading** for performance
- **Backward compatibility** with existing ox_lib imports

## Example Usage (EXPERIMENTAL)

```lua
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL CODE - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

-- Universal player access (works with ESX/QBCore automatically)
local player = lib.core.getPlayer(source)
print(player.citizenid)  -- Works regardless of framework
print(player.money.cash) -- Normalized money structure

-- Universal inventory (works with any inventory system)
lib.inventory.addItem(source, 'bread', 5)
local count = lib.inventory.getItemCount(source, 'bread')

-- Shared enums for consistency
SetVehicleDoorOpen(vehicle, lib.enums.vehicles.DOORS.FRONT_LEFT, false, false)
TaskStartScenarioInPlace(ped, lib.enums.tasks.TASKS.MECHANIC, 0, true)

-- Universal notifications with predefined styles
lib.notify({
    title = 'Success',
    type = lib.enums.notifications.TYPES.SUCCESS,
    icon = lib.enums.notifications.ICONS.MONEY,
    duration = lib.enums.notifications.DURATION.MEDIUM
})
```

## üìú Open Letter to Overextended, CommunityOX, and the FiveM Community

First of all, let‚Äôs be honest: the work done by **Overextended** and **CommunityOX** has raised the bar in FiveM development. Your resources are impressive, your code is sharp, and there's no doubt you‚Äôre some of the most talented developers in this space.

That said ‚Äî and i say this with respect ‚Äî talent doesn‚Äôt excuse toxicity.

Lately, the way some of the leadership in these groups has handled community interactions has created a negative atmosphere. There's been gatekeeping, passive aggression, and a general vibe of ‚Äúus vs them‚Äù that‚Äôs making FiveM feel smaller and more divided than it should be.

We also understand the frustration that comes from seeing your work used without proper respect for the **GPL-3.0** license. That kind of misuse is wrong and unfair ‚Äî no question about it. But those situations should be addressed through the right channels, with clarity and professionalism, not through public hostility or exclusion.

What‚Äôs even more concerning is the way some Discord groups tied to these communities are being used almost like echo chambers ‚Äî where negativity, personal attacks, and hostile behavior towards others are encouraged, even normalized. Turning followers into a tool for spreading resentment doesn‚Äôt help protect your work ‚Äî it just spreads more harm.

This platform was never meant to be controlled by one mindset or one circle. It thrives because people are free to build, share, and explore different ideas without fear of being dismissed or talked down to. When a few voices try to dominate or exclude others, the whole community suffers.

Im not here to cancel anyone. This isn‚Äôt an attack. It‚Äôs a reminder that being a good developer is only part of the picture ‚Äî how we treat people matters just as much.

FiveM deserves to be a place where people can collaborate, not compete for status. Where knowledge is shared, not hoarded. And where differences spark conversation, not conflict.

So here‚Äôs the ask: take a step back. Let‚Äôs shift the tone. Let‚Äôs make FiveM about creating, learning, and growing ‚Äî together.

**There‚Äôs enough room here for everyone.**

**Let‚Äôs make this community better, not smaller.**
